# Entity-Extraction
Here, I have converted image to text format, this text will then be used as our input.
We are able to extract Name, Phone number, email-id, address(works most of the time), Company name, website details.
The input text can be business card and the output will be segregated text and this text will be classified accordingly.
A useful project for android development where the details of the business cards will be stored just by scanning the image of the business card.
Check the Image_Input folder which contains images of the business cards and Text_input folder which contains the Image-to-text converted data and this data is used as input for our file.
